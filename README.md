This is a tool created for people with diabetes, allowing them to keep track of their blood sugar levels, as well as the medication they have taken. The application utilises Firestore to store data on the backend and Firebase authentication to authenticate users. Users are able to create entries which include their blood sugar levels, the time of the day (e.g. Before Breakfast), the time the entry was created (which by default is their current time), and to choose up to three types of medication for their entry. Users can see all their entries on the dashboard where their entries are sorted by date, and they can even edit an entry if they wish to.

### To run the application you have to:

#### Create project on Firebase

#### Create src/config/fbConfig.js file

#### Add Firebase SDK to fbConfig.js file

#### Run npm install

#### Run npm start
